# Description
The code consists of two parts the MatLab code for straight strokes reconstruction *StraightStrokesMatLab* and Python code for curved stroke recosntruction in *CurvedStrokesPython*.
See the README.md files for detailed description of each of the parts.

We are currently working on the unified implementation in Python, which we hope to release in the future.
